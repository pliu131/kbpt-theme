- The Company
The Company
Since 1982, Jake and Richard Kennedy have had one goal in mind: to design and operate a state of the art sports medicine rehabilitation center that offers the most up to date, scientific treatment available. At the same time, it was imperative they find a way to give back to the community. In 1991, their vision was realized with the formation of Kennedy Brothers Physical Therapy. It is a company founded on the concept of providing the highest quality treatment for sports and orthopedic injuries within an increasingly volatile healthcare system. To achieve this feat, careful staff selection was a must. Kennedy Brothers owns and operates five clinics in the greater Boston area. Several of our physical therapists have completed the extensive work and educational requirements, and have passed the rigorous examinations by the American Physical Therapy Association to be certified as Sports Specialists (SCS). Others have studied to become certified Strength and Conditioning Specialists (CSCS). All staff members are involved in monthly continuing education meetings. Kennedy Brothers strongly supports and encourages their clinical staff to keep up with the latest research, surgical techniques and treatment techniques by participating in continuing education courses.

We specialize in treatment for all injuries to the spine, shoulder, elbow, wrist/hand, hip, knee, and foot/ankle. At any time, our clinics are filled with athletes and non-athletes alike ranging in age from 9 to 90. Although Kennedy Brothers is privately owned, we have close working relationships with some of the best orthopedic surgeons in the world at hospitals such as Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General, New England Medical Center, New England Baptist Hospital, Children’s Hospital, Beth Israel Hospital, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital, Newton Wellesley Hospital and Mount Auburn Hospital. These relationships enable the therapists to maintain continuous contact with the referring physician which ensures the best possible, most case specific care.
Kennedy Brothers Physical Therapy believes in putting the well-being of their patients first. We have accomplished this by gathering together a staff of the most qualified sports medicine therapists available. This ensures our patients get only the best possible care for all their sports and orthopedic injuries.

In order to fulfill our strong desire to assist the community around us, Kennedy Brothers has initiated a number of non-profit organizations targeting various needs in the community. One of our greatest ventures has been Christmas in the City. Started in 1990, it is a non-profit organization that raises money year round in order to provide a wonderful day of Christmas cheer and happiness for all the homeless children in Boston and surrounding regions. From Christmas in the City came another wonderful program called Adopt-A-Family Program. You can learn more about these wonderful programs by visiting www.christmasinthecity.org.

Adopt-A-School is yet another charitable organization started by Kennedy Brothers in 1991. This was started in our Boston clinic to serve the needs of a large population of uninsured inner city school children. This program provides free care to Boston public school athletes. We also provide educational inservices to the coaches and athletes on injury prevention. This has been a very rewarding experience for many of our therapists who have been involved.
